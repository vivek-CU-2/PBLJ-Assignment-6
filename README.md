🚀 Experiment 6: Lambda Expressions

📌 Objective

The objective of this experiment is to explore Lambda Expressions and Java Streams in Java. Students will implement solutions to given problems of varying difficulty levels to strengthen their understanding of functional programming concepts.

📜 Assignment Details

The assignment consists of three problems: Easy, Medium, and Hard levels. Each question is designed to enhance your understanding of lambda expressions, stream operations, and functional-style programming in Java.

🟢 Easy Level: Sorting Employees using Lambda Expressions

Problem Statement:

Write a Java program to sort a list of Employee objects (name, age, salary) using lambda expressions.

Expected Learning Outcomes:

Understanding of Lambda Expressions

Sorting Objects using Custom Comparators

Functional Programming in Java

📍 Hint: Use Collections.sort() with a lambda expression for sorting.

🟡 Medium Level: Filtering and Sorting Students using Streams

Problem Statement:

Create a Java program that:

Filters students scoring above 75% using lambda expressions and stream operations.

Sorts the filtered students by their marks.

Displays their names in sorted order.

Expected Learning Outcomes:

Java Streams API

Filtering and Sorting using Lambda Expressions

Functional Programming Paradigm

📍 Hint: Use stream().filter() and stream().sorted() to achieve the desired output.

🔴 Hard Level: Processing a Large Dataset using Streams

Problem Statement:

Write a Java program to process a large dataset of products using streams. Perform the following operations:

Group products by their category.

Find the most expensive product in each category.

Calculate the average price of all products.

Expected Learning Outcomes:

Advanced Java Stream Operations

Grouping and Aggregating Data using Streams

Performance Optimization with Functional Programming

📍 Hint: Use Collectors.groupingBy(), Collectors.maxBy(), and Collectors.averagingDouble().

📢 Happy Coding! 🚀
